# exchanger_system
Hello, this is a simple currency exchange API developed in `Kotlin`
with `Javalin`. Made with `Ubuntu 20.10`.


## Database
In this system, the chosen database was a Postgres v13.4. I used a `docker` 
to set it up and get it running and `docker compose` to simplify configuration.

With a docker installation and a connection to `docker hub` simply download
the postgres image and them run the `docker-compose up` command in the 
`docker-compose.yml` file level
